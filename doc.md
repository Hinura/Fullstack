# 🚀 PHASE 2: ADAPTIVE AI & DYNAMIC DIFFICULTY (Planning - October 2025)

## Next Steps - Dynamic Difficulty Crossing + Adaptive AI

### **Phase 2A: Dynamic Difficulty Mapping**

**Goal:** Create a system where Age 10 "hard" ≈ Age 11 "medium" ≈ Age 12 "easy"

**Implementation Options:**

#### Option 1: Difficulty Score System
- Assign numeric scores to age+difficulty combinations
- Example: Age 10 hard = 13 points, Age 11 medium = 13 points, Age 12 easy = 13 points
- Questions selected based on target difficulty score
- **Pros:** Flexible, granular control, easy to tune
- **Cons:** Requires calibration and testing

#### Option 2: Simple Lookup Table
- Hard-coded mapping of equivalent difficulties
- Example mapping table in database or code
- **Pros:** Simple, predictable, easy to understand
- **Cons:** Less flexible, requires manual updates

**Decision Needed:** Which approach to use?

---

### **Phase 2B: Adaptive Algorithm**

**Goal:** Track performance and dynamically adjust difficulty

#### Key Questions:

**1. What triggers difficulty increase?**
- Option A: 80%+ accuracy on last 3 quizzes in current difficulty
- Option B: 5 correct answers in a row
- Option C: Time-based performance (fast + accurate)
- Option D: Weighted combination of accuracy + speed
- **Decision Needed:** What metric(s) should we use?

**2. What data should we track?**
- Recent performance (last 5-10 attempts per subject)
- Success rate per difficulty level
- Time spent per question
- Questions seen (to avoid repeats)
- Learning velocity (improvement rate)
- **Decision Needed:** Which metrics are most important?

**3. How should we adjust difficulty?**
- Option A: Move to next difficulty within same age group
- Option B: Move to next age group's lower difficulty (dynamic crossing)
- Option C: Mix both - stay in age until hard is mastered, then advance age
- **Decision Needed:** What adjustment strategy?

#### Proposed Database Changes:
```sql
-- Track performance metrics per subject
CREATE TABLE user_performance_metrics (
  user_id UUID,
  subject TEXT,
  current_difficulty_score INTEGER,
  recent_accuracy DECIMAL,
  questions_attempted INTEGER,
  avg_time_per_question INTEGER,
  last_5_attempts JSONB, -- Store recent attempt IDs/scores
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Track which questions user has seen
CREATE TABLE user_question_history (
  user_id UUID,
  question_id UUID,
  times_seen INTEGER,
  times_correct INTEGER,
  last_seen_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

---

### **Phase 2C: AI Integration**

**Goal:** Use AI to provide personalized learning recommendations and insights

#### Key Questions:

**1. Which AI API should we use?**
- Option A: **OpenAI (GPT-4/GPT-4o)**
  - Pros: Powerful, well-documented, wide adoption
  - Cons: More expensive, rate limits
- Option B: **Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**
  - Pros: Better reasoning, longer context, competitive pricing
  - Cons: Newer API, smaller ecosystem
- Option C: **Both with fallback**
  - Pros: Redundancy, can compare results
  - Cons: More complex, higher costs
- **Decision Needed:** Which API provider(s)?

**2. What should AI do?**

**Option A: Subject Recommendations**
- Analyze weak areas across subjects
- Suggest which subject to practice next
- Provide reasoning for recommendation
```typescript
// Example API call
const recommendation = await ai.analyze({
  mathPerformance: 75,
  englishPerformance: 60,
  sciencePerformance: 85,
  recentActivity: [...],
  learningGoals: [...]
})
// Returns: "Focus on English - you're improving but need consistency"
```

**Option B: Personalized Hints**
- Generate context-aware hints during questions
- Adapt hint difficulty to student's level
- Progressive hints (start gentle, get more specific)
```typescript
// Example
const hint = await ai.generateHint({
  question: "What is 15% of 200?",
  studentAge: 12,
  previousAttempts: 1,
  subjectLevel: 3
})
// Returns: "Think about what 10% would be first, then add half of that."
```

**Option C: Custom Difficulty Suggestions**
- AI analyzes performance patterns
- Suggests optimal difficulty adjustments
- Explains reasoning for transparency
```typescript
const suggestion = await ai.suggestDifficulty({
  recentScores: [85, 90, 88, 92],
  currentDifficulty: "medium",
  subject: "math",
  ageGroup: 12
})
// Returns: "Ready for hard questions - consistent high performance"
```

**Option D: Learning Pattern Analysis**
- Identifies learning style (visual, practice-based, etc.)
- Detects struggling patterns (e.g., always wrong on word problems)
- Provides insights to student/teacher/parent
```typescript
const insights = await ai.analyzePatterns({
  last30Days: performanceData,
  questionTypes: [...],
  timeSpentData: [...]
})
// Returns: "Strong with visual problems, struggles with multi-step reasoning"
```

**Decision Needed:** Which AI features to implement? (Can be multiple)

#### Proposed Implementation Structure:
```typescript
// lib/ai/provider.ts
interface AIProvider {
  recommendSubject(userData: UserPerformance): Promise<Recommendation>
  generateHint(question: Question, context: HintContext): Promise<string>
  suggestDifficulty(metrics: PerformanceMetrics): Promise<DifficultyAdjustment>
  analyzePatterns(history: LearningHistory): Promise<Insights>
}

// API endpoint
// app/api/ai/recommend/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { userId, requestType } = await request.json()
  // Call AI provider
  // Return recommendation
}
```
