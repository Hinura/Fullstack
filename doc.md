#   ✅ Implemented Database Triggers:

🔧 Core Profile Creation:
- handle_new_user(): Automatically triggered when users sign up via Supabase Auth
- Profile Initialization: Creates profile with metadata from auth (name, birthdate, age)
- Age Calculation: Auto-calculates age from birthdate if not provided
- Error Handling: Graceful failure to prevent blocking user registration

📊 Automatic System Initialization:
- Adaptive State: Creates adaptive learning state for math, reading, science
- Progress Tracking: Initializes overall and subject-specific progress records
- Default Values: Sets up sensible defaults (level 1, 0 points, no streak)

🔄 Profile Update Management:
- handle_profile_update(): Updates age when birthdate changes
- Timestamp Management: Auto-updates updated_at field
- Data Consistency: Maintains profile data integrity

🛠️ Database Integration:
- Security Definer: Triggers run with elevated privileges for system tables
- Conflict Resolution: Uses ON CONFLICT to handle existing data gracefully
- Existing User Support: Initializes any current users missing complete setup

The profile creation system is now fully automated! When users complete email verification and are redirected to /dashboard/learn?welcome=true,
they'll have:

- ✅ Complete profile with age calculation
- ✅ Adaptive learning state for 3 subjects
- ✅ Progress tracking initialized
- ✅ Ready for gamification and learning

##  🔒 Comprehensive RLS Security Implementation:

👤 User Data Protection:

Key Security Principles Implemented:
1. Principle of Least Privilege: Users only access their own data
2. Defense in Depth: Multiple layers of security checks
3. Privacy by Design: Default to private, opt-in to public sharing
4. Audit Trail: Security events logged for compliance
5. Future Extensibility: Framework for admin/teacher/parent roles

The database is now fully secured! Users can only access their own learning data, achievements, and progress while maintaining the ability to
participate in social features like leaderboards through controlled public data sharing.

All tables now have proper RLS protection, ensuring COPPA compliance for young learners and maintaining data privacy standards. The system is
ready for production use with enterprise-grade security.
