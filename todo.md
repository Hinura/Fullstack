*This todo list represents a comprehensive roadmap for the Hinura platform development. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation for the adaptive learning and gamification systems. Regular reviews and adjustments should be made based on testing results and user feedback.*

 Mandatory Birthdate Setup:
  - Modal Component: Beautiful, non-dismissible modal that appears for users without birthdate
  - Age Validation: Minimum 13 years old (COPPA compliance)
  - Privacy Notice: Clear explanation of data usage
  - Secure API: Prevents multiple birthdate updates once set

  🛡️ Access Restrictions:
  - Dashboard Pages Protected: All pages check for birthdate before allowing access
  - Automatic Redirects: Users without birthdate are redirected to dashboard for setup
  - Consistent UX: Loading states and smooth transitions throughout

  📱 User Experience:
  - Welcome Flow: OAuth users see the setup modal immediately after first login
  - Clear Messaging: Users understand why birthdate is required
  - Professional Design: Matches the existing app aesthetic
  - Error Handling: Comprehensive validation and error messages

  🔧 Technical Implementation:
  - Reusable Hook: useBirthdateCheck for consistent protection across pages
  - API Endpoint: /api/profile/set-birthdate for secure birthdate setting
  - Database Integration: Updates existing profile with birthdate and calculated age
  - Security: Prevents unauthorized access to age-restricted content

  How It Works:

  1. OAuth User Logs In → User data loads without birthdate
  2. Dashboard Detects Missing Birthdate → Shows mandatory setup modal
  3. User Enters Birthdate → Validates age (13+) and saves to database
  4. Modal Closes → User can now access all dashboard features
  5. Future Visits → No restrictions, birthdate is permanent

  🚫 Before Birthdate Setup:
  - ❌ Cannot access Learn, Assessment, Progress, or Profile pages
  - ✅ Can only see dashboard with mandatory birthdate modal

  ✅ After Birthdate Setup:
  - ✅ Full access to all dashboard features
  - ✅ Age-appropriate content delivery
  - ✅ COPPA compliance maintained

  This ensures every user provides their birthdate for proper age verification and content personalization while maintaining a smooth user
  experience!
