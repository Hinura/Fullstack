# 🚀 PHASE 2: ADAPTIVE AI & DYNAMIC DIFFICULTY (Planning - October 2025)

## Next Steps - Dynamic Difficulty Crossing + Adaptive AI

### **Phase 2A: Dynamic Difficulty Mapping**

**Goal:** Create a system where Age 10 "hard" ≈ Age 11 "medium" ≈ Age 12 "easy"

**Implementation Options:**

#### Option 1: Difficulty Score System
- Assign numeric scores to age+difficulty combinations
- Example: Age 10 hard = 13 points, Age 11 medium = 13 points, Age 12 easy = 13 points
- Questions selected based on target difficulty score
- **Pros:** Flexible, granular control, easy to tune
- **Cons:** Requires calibration and testing

#### Option 2: Simple Lookup Table
- Hard-coded mapping of equivalent difficulties
- Example mapping table in database or code
- **Pros:** Simple, predictable, easy to understand
- **Cons:** Less flexible, requires manual updates

**Decision Needed:** Which approach to use?

---

### **Phase 2B: Adaptive Algorithm**

**Goal:** Track performance and dynamically adjust difficulty

#### Key Questions:

**1. What triggers difficulty increase?**
- Option A: 80%+ accuracy on last 3 quizzes in current difficulty
- Option B: 5 correct answers in a row
- Option C: Time-based performance (fast + accurate)
- Option D: Weighted combination of accuracy + speed
- **Decision Needed:** What metric(s) should we use?

**2. What data should we track?**
- Recent performance (last 5-10 attempts per subject)
- Success rate per difficulty level
- Time spent per question
- Questions seen (to avoid repeats)
- Learning velocity (improvement rate)
- **Decision Needed:** Which metrics are most important?

**3. How should we adjust difficulty?**
- Option A: Move to next difficulty within same age group
- Option B: Move to next age group's lower difficulty (dynamic crossing)
- Option C: Mix both - stay in age until hard is mastered, then advance age
- **Decision Needed:** What adjustment strategy?

#### Proposed Database Changes:
```sql
-- Track performance metrics per subject
CREATE TABLE user_performance_metrics (
  user_id UUID,
  subject TEXT,
  current_difficulty_score INTEGER,
  recent_accuracy DECIMAL,
  questions_attempted INTEGER,
  avg_time_per_question INTEGER,
  last_5_attempts JSONB, -- Store recent attempt IDs/scores
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Track which questions user has seen
CREATE TABLE user_question_history (
  user_id UUID,
  question_id UUID,
  times_seen INTEGER,
  times_correct INTEGER,
  last_seen_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

---

### **Phase 2C: AI Integration**

**Goal:** Use AI to provide personalized learning recommendations and insights

#### Key Questions:

**1. Which AI API should we use?**
- Option A: **OpenAI (GPT-4/GPT-4o)**
  - Pros: Powerful, well-documented, wide adoption
  - Cons: More expensive, rate limits
- Option B: **Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**
  - Pros: Better reasoning, longer context, competitive pricing
  - Cons: Newer API, smaller ecosystem
- Option C: **Both with fallback**
  - Pros: Redundancy, can compare results
  - Cons: More complex, higher costs
- **Decision Needed:** Which API provider(s)?

**2. What should AI do?**

**Option A: Subject Recommendations**
- Analyze weak areas across subjects
- Suggest which subject to practice next
- Provide reasoning for recommendation
```typescript
// Example API call
const recommendation = await ai.analyze({
  mathPerformance: 75,
  englishPerformance: 60,
  sciencePerformance: 85,
  recentActivity: [...],
  learningGoals: [...]
})
// Returns: "Focus on English - you're improving but need consistency"
```

**Option B: Personalized Hints**
- Generate context-aware hints during questions
- Adapt hint difficulty to student's level
- Progressive hints (start gentle, get more specific)
```typescript
// Example
const hint = await ai.generateHint({
  question: "What is 15% of 200?",
  studentAge: 12,
  previousAttempts: 1,
  subjectLevel: 3
})
// Returns: "Think about what 10% would be first, then add half of that."
```

**Option C: Custom Difficulty Suggestions**
- AI analyzes performance patterns
- Suggests optimal difficulty adjustments
- Explains reasoning for transparency
```typescript
const suggestion = await ai.suggestDifficulty({
  recentScores: [85, 90, 88, 92],
  currentDifficulty: "medium",
  subject: "math",
  ageGroup: 12
})
// Returns: "Ready for hard questions - consistent high performance"
```

**Option D: Learning Pattern Analysis**
- Identifies learning style (visual, practice-based, etc.)
- Detects struggling patterns (e.g., always wrong on word problems)
- Provides insights to student/teacher/parent
```typescript
const insights = await ai.analyzePatterns({
  last30Days: performanceData,
  questionTypes: [...],
  timeSpentData: [...]
})
// Returns: "Strong with visual problems, struggles with multi-step reasoning"
```

**Decision Needed:** Which AI features to implement? (Can be multiple)

#### Proposed Implementation Structure:
```typescript
// lib/ai/provider.ts
interface AIProvider {
  recommendSubject(userData: UserPerformance): Promise<Recommendation>
  generateHint(question: Question, context: HintContext): Promise<string>
  suggestDifficulty(metrics: PerformanceMetrics): Promise<DifficultyAdjustment>
  analyzePatterns(history: LearningHistory): Promise<Insights>
}

// API endpoint
// app/api/ai/recommend/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { userId, requestType } = await request.json()
  // Call AI provider
  // Return recommendation
}
```

## 📝 Decisions Required

**Before we proceed, please decide:**

1. **Phase 2A:** Difficulty score system OR lookup table?
2. **Phase 2B:**
   - What triggers difficulty increase?
   - Which metrics to track?
   - How to adjust difficulty?
3. **Phase 2C:**
   - Which AI provider(s)?
   - Which AI features to implement?
   - Budget for API calls?

**Let's discuss each decision together before implementing!** 🤝

**Last Updated:** October 3, 2025 - Planning Phase 2

## Problem Analysis

### Issue 1: Linear Age Progression Assumption

```typescript
// Current linear system - FLAWED
Age 10 + Hard = 11
Age 11 + Medium = 11
Age 12 + Easy = 11

// This assumes equal learning gaps between ages, which is false!
```

**Why it fails:**
- A 7→8 year jump is MUCH larger than 16→17
- Early ages show rapid cognitive development
- Teen years show slower, specialized growth

### Issue 2: Individual Variation Ignored

- Gifted 10-year-old = Average 13-year-old
- Current system: Both locked to their age
- No adaptation based on actual performance

## Research-Backed Solution: Adaptive Difficulty with Performance Tracking

### Simplified Architecture: Effective Difficulty Level (EDL)

**Current System Issues:**
- ❌ Static question selection: always uses user's age
- ❌ One-time assessment, no continuous adaptation
- ❌ Skill level (1-5) calculated but not used for question selection

**New Simplified EDL System:**

Instead of static `age + difficulty`, use dynamic adjustment:

```typescript
Effective Age Level = User's Age ± Performance Adjustment (±2 age levels)
```

**Where:**
- User's Age = actual chronological age (7-18)
- Performance Adjustment = calculated from last 10-20 quiz attempts per subject

## Simplified Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Calculate Age Adjustment from Performance

**Simple, research-backed thresholds based on accuracy:**

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate age adjustment based on recent performance
 * Targets 70% accuracy (optimal flow state per Csikszentmihalyi)
 */
function calculateAgeAdjustment(recentAccuracy: number): number {
  // Target zone: 60-75% accuracy (optimal challenge)
  if (recentAccuracy >= 0.85) return 2    // Too easy → jump up 2 ages
  if (recentAccuracy >= 0.75) return 1    // Doing well → up 1 age
  if (recentAccuracy >= 0.60) return 0    // Perfect zone → no change
  if (recentAccuracy >= 0.45) return -1   // Struggling → down 1 age
  return -2                                // Too hard → down 2 ages
}

/**
 * Get effective age for question selection
 */
function getEffectiveAge(
  userAge: number,
  subject: string,
  recentAttempts: QuizAttempt[]
): number {
  // Calculate accuracy from last 10-20 attempts
  const recentAccuracy = calculateRecentAccuracy(recentAttempts)

  // Adjust age based on performance
  const adjustment = calculateAgeAdjustment(recentAccuracy)
  const effectiveAge = userAge + adjustment

  // Clamp to valid range (7-18)
  return Math.max(7, Math.min(18, effectiveAge))
}
```

**Examples:**
- 10-year-old, 90% accuracy → gets age 12 questions (gifted path)
- 10-year-old, 50% accuracy → gets age 9 questions (needs support)
- 14-year-old, 70% accuracy → gets age 14 questions (optimal challenge)

**Visual:**

```
Performance     Age Adjustment      Result for 10yo
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ≥85%       →    +2 ages      →   Age 12 questions
  75-85%     →    +1 age       →   Age 11 questions
  60-75%     →     0 (optimal) →   Age 10 questions ✓
  45-60%     →    -1 age       →   Age 9 questions
  <45%       →    -2 ages      →   Age 8 questions
```

### Step 2: Track Performance Data

**Use existing `quiz_attempts` table** (already in your schema):

```sql
-- Already exists in your database!
quiz_attempts (
  user_id,
  subject: 'math' | 'english' | 'science',
  total_questions,
  correct_answers,
  score_percentage,
  completed_at
)
```

**Calculate recent accuracy:**

```typescript
/**
 * Get recent accuracy for a subject
 * Uses last 10-20 quiz attempts for stability
 */
async function getRecentAccuracy(
  userId: string,
  subject: string,
  limit: number = 15
): Promise<number> {
  const recentAttempts = await supabase
    .from('quiz_attempts')
    .select('correct_answers, total_questions')
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .eq('subject', subject)
    .order('completed_at', { ascending: false })
    .limit(limit)

  if (recentAttempts.length === 0) {
    return 0.70 // Default to 70% (neutral) for new users
  }

  const totalCorrect = recentAttempts.reduce((sum, attempt) =>
    sum + attempt.correct_answers, 0)
  const totalQuestions = recentAttempts.reduce((sum, attempt) =>
    sum + attempt.total_questions, 0)

  return totalCorrect / totalQuestions
}
```

### Step 3: Update Question Selection API

**Modify `/api/questions/route.ts` to use EDL:**

```typescript
// OLD (static):
.eq('age_group', profile.age)

// NEW (adaptive):
const recentAccuracy = await getRecentAccuracy(user.id, subject)
const effectiveAge = getEffectiveAge(profile.age, subject, recentAccuracy)

.eq('age_group', effectiveAge) // Dynamic age based on performance!
```

### Step 4: Database Schema Extension (Optional Enhancement)

Add a cache table for faster lookups:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_performance_cache (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  subject TEXT CHECK (subject IN ('math', 'english', 'science')),
  effective_age INTEGER CHECK (effective_age >= 7 AND effective_age <= 18),
  recent_accuracy DECIMAL(3,2),
  last_updated TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, subject)
);

-- Update trigger after each quiz attempt
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_performance_cache()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Recalculate and cache effective age
  INSERT INTO user_performance_cache (user_id, subject, effective_age, recent_accuracy)
  VALUES (NEW.user_id, NEW.subject,
    calculate_effective_age(NEW.user_id, NEW.subject),
    get_recent_accuracy(NEW.user_id, NEW.subject))
  ON CONFLICT (user_id, subject)
  DO UPDATE SET
    effective_age = EXCLUDED.effective_age,
    recent_accuracy = EXCLUDED.recent_accuracy,
    last_updated = NOW();

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_performance_after_quiz
AFTER INSERT ON quiz_attempts
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_performance_cache();
```

### Step 5: Complete Adaptive Flow

```typescript
// New adaptive question selection
async function getAdaptiveQuestions(userId: string, subject: string) {
  // 1. Get user profile
  const profile = await getUserProfile(userId)

  // 2. Calculate recent accuracy from quiz_attempts
  const recentAccuracy = await getRecentAccuracy(userId, subject, 15)

  // 3. Get effective age (adaptive!)
  const ageAdjustment = calculateAgeAdjustment(recentAccuracy)
  const effectiveAge = Math.max(7, Math.min(18, profile.age + ageAdjustment))

  // 4. Select questions using effective age
  const questions = await supabase
    .from('questions')
    .select('*')
    .eq('subject', subject)
    .eq('age_group', effectiveAge)  // Adaptive age!
    .limit(10)

  return { questions, effectiveAge, recentAccuracy }
}
```

## Complete Example: Gifted 10-Year-Old vs Average 14-Year-Old

### Scenario A: Gifted 10-Year-Old (Sarah)

**After 15 quizzes:**
- Chronological age: 10
- Recent accuracy: 90% (performing excellently)
- Age adjustment: +2
- **Effective age: 12**
- **Gets age 12 questions** (typically for 12-year-olds)

### Scenario B: Average 14-Year-Old (Jake)

**After 15 quizzes:**
- Chronological age: 14
- Recent accuracy: 55% (struggling)
- Age adjustment: -1
- **Effective age: 13**
- **Gets age 13 questions** (one level below)

### Scenario C: Struggling 12-Year-Old (Emma)

**After 15 quizzes:**
- Chronological age: 12
- Recent accuracy: 40% (very difficult)
- Age adjustment: -2
- **Effective age: 10**
- **Gets age 10 questions** (much easier support)

### Result

The system dynamically adapts to each student's **actual performance**, not just their age. Sarah advances, Jake gets appropriate support, and Emma gets the foundational help she needs.

## Continuous Adaptation Flow

```
1. User logs in
     ↓
2. System loads recent quiz_attempts (last 15)
     ↓
3. Calculate accuracy: correct/total across attempts
     ↓
4. Determine age adjustment (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)
     ↓
5. Effective age = user's age ± adjustment
     ↓
6. Select questions for effective age
     ↓
7. User completes quiz → save to quiz_attempts
     ↓
8. Next quiz: Recalculate (loop back to step 2)
```

### Phase 1: Core EDL System (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Create utility functions: `calculateAgeAdjustment()`, `getRecentAccuracy()`, `getEffectiveAge()`
- [ ] Update `/api/questions/route.ts` to use effective age instead of static age
- [ ] Test with mock data to verify age adjustment logic

### Phase 2: Performance Tracking (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Ensure `quiz_attempts` properly saves all quiz data
- [ ] Create `/api/performance/route.ts` to fetch recent accuracy
- [ ] Add optional `user_performance_cache` table for optimization

### Phase 3: UI & Visualization (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Display effective age vs chronological age on dashboard
- [ ] Show performance trends over time (accuracy graph)
- [ ] Add "You're working at Age X level" indicator

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Week 4)
- [ ] Test with multiple user scenarios (gifted, average, struggling)
- [ ] Verify adaptation happens within 10-15 quizzes
- [ ] Document results for thesis
