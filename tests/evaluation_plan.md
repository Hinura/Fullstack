# Evaluation Plan

## Goals
- Verify adaptive difficulty works correctly.
- Measure user engagement and learning effectiveness.

## Metrics
- Accuracy trend per user
- Difficulty shift counts (easy → medium → hard)
- Average points per session
- User feedback: “too easy / ok / too hard”

## Protocol
- Recruit **3–5 test users**
- Each user answers **30 exercises** across topics
- System records accuracy, points, and difficulty progression
- Collect short user feedback survey

## Outputs
- 3 charts (accuracy trend, difficulty shift, avg points/session)
- 1 summary table for results
- Qualitative notes from user feedback
